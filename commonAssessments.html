          <h3>Tegan and Sara Discography</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>For my DDM, I created a website about the band named “Tegan and Sara”. I started off my website by working on
          the homepage for the website. I created a header, which contains the logo for the website and links to most of
          the other pages on my website. This is where I put the required link to their official website. I created the
          link by using the a tag. I also made a footer that contains the link to the sources page. I added a h1 element
          to the top of the page, and centered it. This was to tell the user what page they were on. I copy and pasted
          these things on every page so they would all be consistent with each other, and changed what was in the h1
          element depending on the page. I then added a p tag to create a paragraph on the page, and wrote a short
          biography about the band. I also decided the color scheme and applied it to all of the pages. That was
          everything needed for the home page so I moved onto the band members page. I created an image on the page of a
          band member by using the img tag, and also created some paragraphs underneath it to add the information needed
          about the members. I put all of these in a div tag to help format the page and code better. I centerer the
          pictures and paragraphs, and then repeated the same things for the other members, filling in the different
          information. This finished up the band members page, so I moved on to the discography page. I did the same
          thing to add the pictures of the album covers as the pictures on the band members page. I then added an
          ordered list by using the ol tag, and listed the songs in the album. I centered the ordered list and the
          pictured so they were next to each other in the middle of the page. I also added an h3 element above them to
          list the name of the album, and used em to italicize it. Under that I added a h4 element to write the date of
          the album's release. I repeated these for all of the other albums. For the last part of the project, the
          sources page, I added a table tag, and organized the links and what I used on the website in the table by
          using tr and td.

          For the computer science principles ap test I had to create an app and explain how it functions. My app allows
          students using multiple different devices to wirelessly vote on questions that their teacher enters into the
          app. There is a teacher version of the app, which allows the user to change the questions and reset the vote
          counter, and there is a student version that only allows the user to view the question and vote on it once.
        </p>

          This is the code that I created that moves the sliders to display the percentage of agree or disagree votes.
          When the updateDisplay procedure is called, the if statement is run to make sure that the agreeCount and the
          disagreeCount added together isn’t 0. If the if statement passes, an equation is run that determines what
          percentage of votes are agree/disagree, and then the sliders are set accordingly. If the if statement fails
          because the votes added together is 0, then the sliders are reset back to 0 and global answered is set to
          false.

          This code inhibits the user of the app from voting more than once. When the user votes by clicking on either
          ButtonDisagree or ButtonAgree, there is an if statement that runs to check if the global variable answered is
          set to false. If the statement passes, then the vote is counted and global answered is set to true. If the
          statement fails, then a notifier is run, telling the user that they have already voted. The votes are reset by
          the updateDisplay procedure. When the reset button is clicked it sets the vote counts back to 0. This causes
          the if statement in the updateDisplay procedure to fail, which then sets global answered to false, allowing
          the user to vote again.

          In the teacher version of the app the user is allowed to change the questions and reset the votes. To change
          the question, the user types the question into the text box at the top of the screen and then hits
          buttonChangeTxt, which calls the procedure storeDBvalues. This stores the question they typed into the cloud
          database, where it is then extracted by the student version and displayed on their screen. The reset button
          simply sets the vote count back to 0 and stores the changed values, which in turn allows the users to vote
          again.

          <h3>Java Crossword</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>
          My Junior year DDM was to program a crossword puzzle in Java. The program would have to take in information about the puzzle from a text file using a scanner, then separate the data and create clue objects with it. The clue objects would be used to create the crossword board, display clues to the user, and check if the user entered the correct word in the right spot. The program also has lots of input validation; if the user enters a string when they should enter a number, the program doesn’t crash, but tells the user that they entered an invalid input. The program makes sure that the user doesn’t enter a word that is too long, doesn’t match with existing letters on the board, or contains numbers.
        </p>

        <p class = "sophomoreDDM">
          File handling is an extremely important part of computer programming, and is something that I was taught the basics of this year. I am easily able to read data from a text file and use it in my programs. In my DDM, there is a fileUtils class, which handles everything that has to do with reading the files. The method readFile(File file) takes in a file object and then iterates through it using a scanner and a while loop. The while loop condition is hasNext(), which checks the file to make sure that it has another line to read. The scanner reads the file, then splits it and creates a clue object to hold all of the data from the line. The clue object is added to a list, and when the while loop breaks, the array of clues is returned. If the readFile() has a try catch block, so if it fails to read the file, then it asks the user to enter the name of the file and then calls the method again with the new file, preventing the program from crashing.
        </p>

        <p class="sophomoreDDM">
          The main part of the program is the Crossword class. The constructor for this class has no parameters, but when an object is made the readFile() method is called and the list of clues is saved in the class. Still in the constructor, the createCrossword method is called, which uses the clue list to create the board. The board can be any size, as it looks through the text file and changes the size of the board accordingly. The method first changes the squares to contain the number of the word and a ‘.’, which represents a white space. Then it changes all of the null squares to ‘*’, which represents a black space.
