      <h2>High School Reflection</h2>
      
      <p>In 2020 and 2021, my freshman year in high school, most people were stuck in their homes because of the COVID-19 pandemic. For more than half of the year we had to learn remotely, which was difficult for a number of reasons: old school teachers had to try and use new technology, distractions at home, wifi troubles, and more. Eventually we returned to in school learning and were able to go through exploratory, which is when freshmen try a number of different shops to see what they’re interested in. I didn’t enjoy the shop cycle at this time very much, as the constant transition between shops made it difficult to truly learn much about each one. However, after choosing computer science, I grew to look forward to the shop cycle so I could learn more about my trade. We started to learn programming languages and also how to code websites, which I had never done before. Every day we were learning new things, which kept me interested and engaged throughout the year. 
   <br></br>   At the beginning of my Sophomore year, everybody still had to wear masks, but halfway through the year the mask mandate was lifted. Gradually, everybody began to show their faces. It felt odd because things were back to normal, but it had been so long since people hadn’t worn masks in public, so it still felt wrong. However, I was able to overcome this feeling fairly quickly. Most of my focus that year was towards the AP computer science course I was taking and studying for MCAS.
      In academics, I mainly focused on preparing myself for MCAS. In order to graduate from high school, you had to pass MCAS, so I was pretty nervous about taking the test. At that point in my life, it was probably the most important test I had ever taken, so I made sure to take it seriously. In English, I mostly honed my literary skills by completing several essays on complex books such as The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde. In math, I was taught the remaining material required for MCAS and then spent the rest of the year reviewing what I had learned throughout the time I had spent in school. History and science were the same as every other year; in history, the subject was US history II, and in science, it was technology and engineering. I had to complete multiple projects about the different topics that we discussed, and at times it was a little overwhelming, but it was never too bad. As MCAS came closer and closer, I became more and more nervous, but I knew that I was prepared after all of the practice I received. Academics were a little challenging that year, but I think that the shop was a lot harder. In shop, the main thing that I worked on was completing an AP course in computer science. It was a long and grueling process, but I eventually finished the course and took the test. My peers and I would receive our grades during the summer, but I was quite confident that I had passed. We worked on IoT, which was an interesting topic that I hadn’t heard much about before the course. It was mostly about big data and how many devices were becoming smart, but there were also things like building circuits, programming redboards, and Arduinos. Web design was also a major part of the shop that year. Many of my classmates and I qualified for the web design SkillsUSA districts competition, which was exciting as I had never done something like that before. My teammate and I didn’t win, but next year we had a better chance as we knew what to expect. 
      <br></br>My Junior year in computer science saw me returning to a more conventional coding language. I was taught the basics of Java in Code HS, and Mr. Riley was there to assist me if I was stuck or didn’t understand a particular assignment. Eventually, after I had completed the course, Mr. Riley started assigning me small programs, such as creating a Factory Worker program, which took in user input, printed to the console, and used multiple classes. A few months later, he started assigning more extensive programs that would be made over a week or two, not just a few days. These assignments were a bit more challenging, as there was more code to keep track of and organize, and it was sometimes hard to remember where I had left off the day before. He also presented a small glimpse into JavaFX, allowing the programmer to create an interface using CSS quickly. At the beginning of the year, I struggled with adapting to the conventions of Java. The only language that I knew that remotely resembled it was Python, and I had not touched that for more than a year. CodeHS had me start with the basics: print statements, if statements, and loops. After completing the initial assignments, I began to conform to the new conventions, and I found Java much more appealing than Python and Blockly. Over the next few months, I would learn about arrays, 2D arrays, polymorphism, recursion, and more. With the skills I had developed from my time using CodeHS, I began to create programs with more substance; they had multiple classes, getters and setters, and many more lines of code. I found this part of the year very enjoyable, as most programs were relatively simple, and I was learning much about what I wanted to have a career in. One of the programs that I created during this time was Factory Workers. This program was more complex than the rest of the programs we had written, as this one wrote and read from a text file. Using scanners, my program could read from the text file and take in user input, and the file got read using a file reader. I also used superclasses and subclasses, as many different kinds of factory workers could be employed. The program's main point was to calculate a worker's salary depending on what they did and also keep track of them in the text file using an ID number that got assigned to them. It didn’t take me long to finish the program; it probably took three hours at most. However, the program reinforced my programming skills and made me feel more confident in my abilities. 
      <br></br>In my senior year I was given the freedom to choose what my senior project, something that I would work on throughout the year, would be. Considering what we had learned last year, I decided to use javaFX to create a simple farming game. I began working on this project at the beginning of the year, and was able to integrate different things that I was learning throughout the year into the project, such as SQL. I learned how to create and utilize databases in SQL, and then implemented this into my project by using a database and numerous tables to contain the information about all items that would be put into my game. The items each have an id, and the java program selects the items using this id. The program can then extract all of the data about the item and create an appropriate object, such as a seed or tool, which are all sub-classes of the tool class. This is so all of the item sub-classes can have a use item method which will do different things depending on the class, and because all of the sub-classes need to contain similar item data. While I was given a lot of time to work on this project, I was still assigned other things in order to further reinforce my JavaFX and SQL skills. One of the assignments that I completed was a movie booking application, which allowed users to add movies to a database and buy tickets for those movies. All of the transaction and movie information was stored in an SQL database, and all UI and app functionality was done with JavaFX and Scenebuilder. A lot of the work that I did this year was about reinforcing the skills that I had acquired the year prior, but I also learned how to use SQL which will help create opportunities for me in the future.
