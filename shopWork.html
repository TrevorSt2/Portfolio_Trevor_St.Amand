          <h3>April Vacation Website</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>This year in the computer science shop we learned about python and web design. We have done many projects
          with both, and one of the projects for web design was to create an april vacation website, explaining what you
          were going to do on a fictional vacation to anywhere you wanted. In order to create the website, I had to use
          the things that I had learned previously, such as using tables and creating figures with pictures.
        </p>

        <p class="secondP"> For my project, I decided to go to New York City, because I had never been before. I had to
          create multiple
          pages for the project, which was easy to do. Each page contained different information, such as the cost of
          the
          vacation. I had to create a table in order to list out the cost of the vacation, and that was something that I
          had just learned. I also created an image gallery by using css and figures. </p>

          <h3>Wordle Game Website</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>Torble is a wordle-like game that I created with Benjamin Ponte using j-query and html. In order to guess a
          word you have to click the guess button and input the word you want to guess. The game checks the input to see
          if it is 5 letters, an actual word, etc. Like in Wordle, the letters will turn green, yellow, or gray
          depending on if they are in the word or not. The corresponding letters on the keyboard will also light up. If
          you have guessed too many times, the game will prevent you from guessing again and tell you what the word was.
          You can start a new game at any time by clicking the new button next to the guess button. This will clear the
          board and the keyboard and select a new word. There is a hamburger menu on the top right of the screen that
          contains the option for dark mode. When clicked, it changes the website into dark mode, and if clicked again
          after that, switches back to light mode
        </p>

        <p class="secondP">All of the visuals on the screen are done with html and css, while the Wordle part is coded
          with J-Query. We chose to use J-Query over normal Javascript because we found that it was easier and more
          convenient to use.</p>

        <h3>JavaFX Battleship</h3>


        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p> The programming side of shop in my junior year was mostly about transferring Python skills to Java, learning
          JavaFX, and preparing for the AP exam. I spent the first part of the year learning Java’s syntax in CodeHS,
          which is slightly different from what I was used to in python, but not that hard. Both Java and Python are
          object oriented programming languages, so they function somewhat the same. After learning how to code basic
          things in Java, I practiced by coding basic programs, such as FactoryWorkers. These programs, along with
          practice tests from previous AP exams, helped prepare me for the Computer Science B AP exam at the end of the
          year.
        </p>

        <p class="secondP">
          The latter half of the year was spent learning how to create programs with graphic user interfaces (GUIs) in
          JavaFX. This made the programs much better looking, and more accessible for users. One of the programs that I
          created was a simple recreation of battleship. The player could place ships on their side of the screen, and
          the computer would place ships on their side of the screen. The user could then attack the bots side, and the
          bot could attack the user until one player blew up all of the other players ships. This project was probably
          the largest of the year, and the most difficult, but I learned a lot while making it, such as how to add event
          handlers to objects that don’t get created until the program is run.

        <h3>Movie Theater Management Program</h3>


        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>
          Senior year was spent reinforcing all of the skills that I had learned throughout my previous three years in computer science. This includes SQL, Java, JavaFX, CSS, HTML, python, and JavaScript. I created many programs that mimiced what I would be required to create in the real world, such as the movie theater management program.
        </p>

        <p class="secondP">
          The movie theater management program was created using JavaFX, SQL, and CSS. The program allows the user to easily view, manipulate, and buy tickets for movies in a mySQL database. The UI that was created using JavaFX and CSS makes it easy for people with varying technical abilities to fully use the program. The UI changes by switching to different scenes that were created in scenebuilder. The functionality and information is filled in by the program and database when the screen is changing. The most complex part of the app is probably the add movie. The information is fetched from the database and stored in a table, and when the user clicks on the movie in the table its information is displayed. The user can also add movies to the database on this screen by filling in all of the necessary info, such as a picture, title, and relase date. Allowing the user to add a picture was difficult, as I had to write code that opens file explorer and allows the user to select an image from their computer.
