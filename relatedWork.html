          <h3>Cisco Cybersecurity Course</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p>This year’s related topic was on cyber security, an extremely important and necessary part of the computer
          science industry. Without it, computers would not be safe to use and we wouldn’t even be close to where we are
          with technology today. Of what we learned about cyber security over the course of the school year, I believe
          that the cyber security cube was the most interesting topic that we went over.

        </p>

        <p class = "fortnite"> The cyber security cube has three dimensions, and each dimension represents a fundamental part of the cyber
          security industry. Each dimension has three subcategories which make up the whole side of the cube. The first
          dimension of the cube is information states, which are the different states that data can be in. The
          subcategories that make it up are transmission, which is data being moved, storage, which is data at rest, and
          processing, which is data in use. The second dimension is countermeasures, which is about how cyber attacks
          are prevented from happening. The three subcategories are technology, policies and practices, and people. The
          last side is security principles, which is about how you can keep data and other information safe and
          available. The subcategories are confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
        </p>

        <p class="secondP">
          I thought that this was interesting to learn about because everything else that we learned about this year
          related back to the cyber security cube. Each side of the cube is very important, and if one of the sides went
          away, then cyber security would fail. If countermeasures were taken out of the cube, then we wouldn’t be able
          to defend against cyber attacks.

          <h3>Cisco IFTTT Lab</h3>
        </a>

        <!-- Change the font or something to make this look better and more interesting -->

        <p> Over the course of my sophomore year in computer science, we covered a wide range of subjects in the Cisco IOT fundamentals course. One of the main subjects that we covered was IFTTT (If This Then That). IFTTT is a public web service that enables creative control and automated interactions between various cloud based services like Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Dropbox, Webex Teams, etc. The interactions are defined in IFTTT using small scripts called applets – as simple as “if” something happens, “then” trigger some action. This year I used IFTTT to send an email to me when it was going to rain. 

        </p>

        <p class="secondP">
          The first thing that I did was create a program on IFTTT that utilized an applet called “weather underground” to add an event called sunrise and sunset to my google calendar. Then I had to build a circuit that connected with the red board, which was connected to an arduino. I ran multiple segments of python code that connected the arduino to the IFTTT program that I had made. Using the data collected from the photosensor, the arduino added sunlight and sunset events to my google calendar through IFTTT.
        </p>

        <p class="fortnite">
          Before doing this assignment, I had never used the arduino’s to connect to something else like a website, so I didn’t really have an idea of what practical use they had. Using the Arduino and IFTTT to change my google calendar gave me an idea of what else they could be used for.

        <p>Related in my junior year was spent learning how to code and design games using Unity.	 The first game that I created was a version of Breakout, which was originally developed by Atari in 1976. The game is very simple, and a good place to start when learning to code in c#. While creating the game I learned how to create objects in the scene, how to put scripts on them, and many other useful things that are necessary to learn in order to code more complex games. This is also when I learned how to make things move using vectors and rigid bodies.

        </p>

        <p class="secondP">The second game that I created was called Sunnyland. It was a platformer, so it was much more complex than the brick breaker game, which only had two moving parts. In this game the player could move, jump, and climb walls. There were enemies that moved, and carefully designed levels, created using sprite tiles. I was able to use many of the skills that I had acquired  in the previous project in this one, such as making things move. Allowing the player to wall-jump was a new challenge. I had to use a child object to detect of the player was close to a wall, and if they were, I wrote code to make it so they stuck and then slowly slid down.</p>
